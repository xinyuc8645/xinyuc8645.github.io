            <h2>Context</h2>
              <p><h4>Alright so, for this project, it's a little bit special. Unlike the previous two project, this project was basically all year long. I'll try my best to shorten the context so you can dive straight into the contents.
              Basically for this project, we had to decide on an topic that we would research on. And there is no limit to what topic you choose. Except from the restrictions of Artifical Intelligences. And so, I choose animation as my topic for my freedom project. However, the catch is once you choose that topic you can't go back to other topic anymore.
              I was 100% sure I wouldn't go back so I chosed animation. First we had to search up initial impacts our topic would have towards the society, laws, social lifes and etc. Then we had to research. But research what exactly? Well, more specfically researching about softwares and hardwares. The softwares were considered part A of the freedom project. And so I did
              The software I found that relates to my topic was Adobe. And as for the hardwares, considered as part B in the freedom project, I found drawing tablet, CPU, and lastly zoetrope. Then we would put these information altogether in order to form an information type section. Then as this goes on, during the background we were also doing lessons on HTML, CSS and bootstraps that would later contribute to LOYO website.</p></h4>
              <p><h4>Before creating our website related to my topic, we first had to learn an tool. There were many to choose from, and I chosed Aframe, since it was easy and very viable to use. I took 2-3 weeks to learn that tool. Then after we put all those informaton into an complete website. After creating the website we had to present to in front of the whole class, about what our website is about, codes, challenges, you face and etc.
              After the presentation I was given feedback base on my performance, and I looked over it and I think I could improve next time. Then our last task was the expo. Before the expo we had to practice elevator pitch, which means an quick 1 minute summary introduction about my website. And that's basically all for SEP10 Freedom Project for the contexts.</p><h4>
            
        
            <h2>Contents</h2>
            <h4>The contents includes:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Slide Show Presentation About My Website </h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Product Of My Website</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Screenshots of my tool Aframe</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Informations About My Part A and Part B</h4></li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Product of my Website</h2>
                <p><h4>Alright so, as previously mentioned, you should already know what lead to my website of animation. So for this section I'll explained what I put in there and how I created it. At first, I was going to use an bootstrap template to start my website, however there was an major issue. The main issue being that with free bootstrap templates come with code you don't know.
                Why is that an issue you may ask? Well, if you try changing it, it will be difficult since you don't know what codes does what, and there would be an higher chance that you would mess up your website and the coding as a whole. So I resorted to start from scratch. I first started off my website with the background colors. I usually would go for 1 color background, however thinking that this was the last project for this year I decided to do something special
                I decided that there should be multple color at once. More specfically and referring to linear-gradient. If you don't know what that is, basically from one color to another. So I had my color for my background from white--> to blue--> then to dark blue-->. And then my text color would be white, since that's the only color that compliments well with my background. After finishing that I put in an navbar.</h4></p>
                <p><h4>The navbar was essential and it was nothing special. I just made the navbar to be fixed-top and the background color to have an blue like color to fit the theme of my website. And after setting all that up. It's time to put in all my information into my website. By far, this was the most easily thing do to. Because all I had to do with copy and paste, since I had the information beforehand. After doing that I just have to create each section for what part. For example, top: the introduction about animation.
                Underneath that, part A; talks about the software(Adobe), beneath that part B; talks about hardwares, and below that, carousel referring to the hardwares, and below that is some aspect of the aframe tool along side with soem pictures, and bottom of the website faq section. There were some bootstrap component I used, for example for the FAQ section, I used accordion, navbar that is responsive, carousel for images, card components to fit the information/images.
                And that's basically all of my website. If you would like to further check the website out, <a href="https://xinyuc8645.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/">here/a><br>

                Here are some preview images of the product of my website.</p></h4>

            <h2>Slide Show Presentation<h2>
                <p><h4>For the slide show it wasn't anything special. For the planning of the slideshow there were 4 main components I have to worry about. One the hook, to hook the audience. Two content, showing code snippets explaining them, and some what's in your website. Third an ending/outro that would be an takeaway overall. And something not required directly in the slide show but more outside is eye contact, and speaking loud and clear
                To be honest, those components were all easy to fulfill, for the hook, I introduced my slide with GIFS of animated scenes to hook the audiences in and grab their attention, because I know people watch those shows. Then I had an interactive hook, with me calling out one of my friend, telling him if he's ready to learn more about animation.</p></h4>
                <p><h4>Before that happen I put "are you ready to learn more about my animation?" So I asked my friend, my friend kept saying no, even though I expecte a yes, but that's fine. Because the next slide I did a 360, because instead of learning about animation I tell them you would learn more about the creation of my website instead! But I guess it worked?? Then after that I had some quick demo of my website. And then some components I used in my website, and then my takeaway at the end saying "more imagination, less procesination."
                Overall I think what made my slides smooth were because I added some animation to my slide, like one GIF would fly in from the topic and the other one would fly in at the bottom. Moving on, when the whole presentation was done for everyone we got our feedbacks from the teacher back. I got an 8.5 because, my takaway was too vague and the images for my code snippets were a bit hard to see.
                But upon, seeing the feedback I now know what I could improve for future presentation. And that's basically all for the slide show.

            <h2>Aframe Tool<h2>


            <h2>Part A/Part B<h2>
            <p><h4>As previously explained and mentioned, I did research on softwares and hardwares base off of my topic of animation. For Part A the requirement was to research an software that would relate to topic of animation. It didn't take me long to find one. And the one I found was adobe. Adobe wasn't just some random software animation website, it actually was popular
                and thus started my research on adobe. Upon researching, adobe I learned that adobe has so many tools an animator need. And for the Part B, we were required to research an hardware. We had to search 3 more specfically. The 3 I found that relate to my topic of animation were, CPU, drawing tablet, and zoetrope. If you don't know what an zoetrope is, basically it is an old animating tool, where you have certain frames of an object, then you put that frame in the zoetrope in an circle,
                then it would start spinning very fast, making it seem like if that object was actually moving. And as for the other 2 it's pretty self explainatory. And that's basically all for Part A and Part B. Oh, and before I forget, part B required an future invention. To be honest I kind of forgotted about this.
                So, I had to quickly think up of one. And the future invention I came up with is an robotic tool/hand that would help reduce the animators time needed to animate an certain frame, so their hand doesn't get tire and would require less work and would result in more faster production.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <h4>To be honest, there wasn't any too difficult challenge I faced for this project, but if I had to say one it probably had to do with paragraphs not allinging and images proportions. The reason why I am saynig this is because, if you look at my website for the seciton Part A and Part B, you notice there is 3 paragraphs side by slide.
                However, prior to this happening it wasn't side by side, instead it was constantly overlapping each other. I kept trying to put it in container-fluid, rows, and etc. However that didn't really help out. Instead it reminded me of something. At the start of the bootstrap lesson, I learned that an basic screen size there is 12 grids spreaded evenly across. So that means
                if I have 3 paragraphs and wanted them to be side by side, that would mean I just have to make them take up 4 space each paragraph, and so I did. I applied that to both Part A and Part B. Honestly this was a life saver, because if I didn't learn about bootstrap or think of this, honestly I would of showcased my website, with overlapping paragraphs instead.
                Another challenge I face was with the image proportion specfically for my carousel. The reason is because when I applied the carosuel on to my website, and put the images, when I refreshed the page, the image were so large that it basically takes up 100% of the screen. At first I didn't know what to do. But then I turned to width and height.
                I changed both height and width but that didn't seemed to work. So instead of changing both, I changed only width to 85% so that it wouldn't take up 100% of the website size.</h4>
                <h1>Reflections</h1>
                <h2>TakeAways</h2>
                To be honest the takeaways for this project, is defintely be passionate, less procesnating and trying your best. Because believe it or not, at first I had little to barely any motivation, however after some things started to kick in, it made me feel very passion about this project as a whole.
                And if you are seeing this portfilo, now I was procesnating a lot doing this and delayed to now. And yea.
