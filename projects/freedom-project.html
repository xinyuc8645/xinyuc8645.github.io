            <h2>Context</h2>
              Alright so, for this project, it's a little bit special. Unlike the previous two project, this project was basically all year long. I'll try my best to shorten the context so you can dive straight into the contents.
              Basically for this project, we had to decide on an topic that we would research on. And there is no limit to what topic you choose. Except from the restrictions of Artifical Intelligences. And so, I choose animation as my topic for my freedom project. However, the catch is once you choose that topic you can't go back to other topic anymore.
              I was 100% sure I wouldn't go back so I chosed animation. First we had to search up initial impacts our topic would have towards the society, laws, social lifes and etc. Then we had to research. But research what exactly? Well, more specfically researching about softwares and hardwares. The softwares were considered part A of the freedom project. And so I did
              The software I found that relates to my topic was Adobe. And as for the hardwares, considered as part B in the freedom project, I found drawing tablet, CPU, and lastly zoetrope. Then we would put these information altogether in order to form an information type section. Then as this goes on, during the background we were also doing lessons on HTML, CSS and bootstraps that would later contribute to LOYO website.
              Before creating our website related to my topic, we first had to learn an tool. There were many to choose from, and I chosed Aframe, since it was easy and very viable to use. I took 2-3 weeks to learn that tool. Then after we put all those informaton into an complete website. After creating the website we had to present to in front of the whole class, about what our website is about, codes, challenges, you face and etc.
              After the presentation I was given feedback base on my performance, and I looked over it and I think I could improve next time. Then our last task was the expo. Before the expo we had to practice elevator pitch, which means an quick 1 minute summary introduction about my website. And that's basically all for SEP10 Freedom Project for the contexts.
            
        
            <h2>Contents</h2>
            <h4>Okay so for the contents originally I was planning to name all of the files path and what they would led into other options, however if I did do that, that will take an eternity. So basically I'm just quickly sum up all the contents available.</h4>
            <h4>The contents includes:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Drawing planning sheet </h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Our plans</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>And most if not all the choices in the adventures, and I believe it has up to 10+ different paths for each choices you take.</h4></li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p><h4>At first, when me and my partners were planning for this adventure project, it looked really overwhelming. However, after thinking and discussing with my partners it's actually quite simple. But first how will we start off this project? Well, since you need different choices that leds to different results, we have to brainstorm a lot of them.So 
            in order to make my life for both easier for me and my partners we divided to split up the work. My partner will put the ideas in the google drawing so whomever is viewing the drawing of our different choices to different path they will have an easier time. And I'll brainstorm the different ideas. So I created a  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eeAmLwzMT9_0eRKtA3LoVeIKc7rP2t24zRuAeJvbqwY/edit?usp=sharing">seperate google doc</a>. Of course with this said, </h4></p>
            <p><h4>I still had to contributed to the google drawing planning, because I can't just let my partners do all the work by themselves. But for the google doc, I can do it by myself since it will be easier to brainstorm. Since our main topic revolves around isekai'd into a fantasy world, many sub-choices intrigues me, for example I first started brainstorm of creating 2 main paths. 
            Originially, I had to create 3 paths however it would take way too long and would be very time consuming so I decided not to create 3 paths. But 2. Just to list a few, for the main path that will led you to 2 sub main paths would be that, the main option being "You going to a grocery store and restocking for supplies, however you encounter a gang of people trying to harass a girl"</h4></p>
            <p><h4>And the choices for that were, "trying to helping the girl", or "running away like a coward". You can view the <a href= "https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1555FU168n4N28vml-cbixX7-OelLUawSYsdOMAVmDrA/edit">google drawing planning sheets</a> here, however this sheet is not 100% completed the results were almost the identical to each other, since either way you still died. If you choose helping the girl, you died as a result of getting stabbed by a knife. And if you decide to choose to run away like a coward, you eventually get hit by a truck.
            However, the main differences is the good and bad path. Of course, if you choose the helping choice, good thing will bestow upon you after reincarnating. However if you choose running away, bad thing will bestow upon you. Now you get a general gist of what and how planning is done. Since if I keep explaining the planning it will be the same process over and over again. So
            now let's move on into the main challenges and the results of the project.</h4></p>

            <h2>Result/Challenges</h2>
            <p><h4>So, for the result of this project, I must say I'm quite proud of this project that me and my partners create. However when it was the day for my classmates to test out our game, there are some bugs and issues that occur and some feedbacks. To be honest, for this feedback I don't know if you count it as a compliment or a needs to change thingy. Because one of the major criticism we had were,
            the whole process or reading and clicking was too boring. I mean I kind of could relate to this issues since after all, my partner did wanted to do the extra credit for extra grade so we did it on a HTML format, however the only 2 color were black and white, so it kind of is boring to play around with.
                And I think we could of added a background to our HTML adventure project, because for one group that I visited they also did their project in their HTML format and they did add like an image to their background to make it more interesting for the players and the audiences.</h4></p>
                <p><h4>Another small issue we came across and got feedback on slack, was people asking if there were suppose to be an end to our project. Since when me and my partners were making the project we made it so that there isn't a "true ending" to the project but instead, everytime you died you always loop back to the beginning like an infinite loop. We made it this way because we don't want you to just die when you click on an choice, since now you have now where to go 
                and you have to go all the way back to the main file starting point again. So we decide to make it easier and making you stuck in a loop but with various choices and results to explore. Last but least, the main challenge that I came across were sometimes the links directing to a certain file would not work and be broken instead. Now this is very troublesome because I had to manually see which file is connected to which and the deeper the file is the harder it is to search for it
                since the files for my project work in a way like this. There's a hierarchy of files that is located at the beginning and as players start to press more and more choices they dive deeper into the file. But in the end I managed to resolved this issue at ease.</h4></p>
                <p><h4>Now for the challenges, to be honest there weren't many challenges during this project. I think the main challenge of this actual project is actually the ability to communicate between you through to your partners. That is because, sometimes me and my partners work separate times, so I don't know what my partner deleted or added unless, I check the github commit logs and not just git pulling randomly. Now I'm not saying this was a huge issue but it is a issue I found occurring for my working in my group. So I don't know if any other group had this issue occur.
                Another challenge I would say that I kind of face were doing the extra credit. The extra credit was making the project into the HTML project, at first I thought it was pretty simple, however when I ask some of my friends, and when they show me what the extra credit I was honestly shocked. I didn't think you have to make the project to be view in the http-server format. I didn't know how to do that so I had one of my friend teach me. </h4></p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p><h4>The main takeaway of this whole project is, learning to communicate with your team-mate, and practicing how to use certain codes in our IDE. That is because without communication and let's say you are doing everything in IDE you and your partner are working at the same time, however with no communication or any type of communicating you will not know when to pull or push in order to get the information or to push out the information. So I think this is more so of an important project of learning 
                better to communicate with our classmate and strengthening our relationship between each other so we can get to know each other better and not being like shy to interact with one another. This project is also an GREAT way of improving your IDE learning skills because in the past, we mainly are focused on doing solo project and homeworks based on ourself and we aren't really git pulling anything.</h4></p> 
                <p><h4>Instead we are only git pushing. So with this project we can learn better to do that and you can actually try
                git pulling yourself so you can see what your partner has changed. If there was another project that was alike, like this one preferably, I would like to choose my own team-mate and maybe avoid extra credit?.. The reason why I said avoiding extra credit is because, even though extra credit serves as extra bonus and boost in grade it kind of uses up more time to do it. Believe it or not, if my partners did not want extra credit, this project probably would of only took at least 3 days to complete in terms of using our times wisely and working on our other homeworks.
                However since my partners wanted extra credit, the project needed maxmimum at least an extra day or two because the whole HTML extra credit was both confusing to me and my partner. Since I thought all you had to do was add like HTML markdown codes in your project, but in reality its more like making your whole project into HTML style and using http-server to view it.</h4></p>
