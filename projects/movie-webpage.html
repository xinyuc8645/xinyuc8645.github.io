            <h2> Context</h2>
            For this project, I was pair up with an partner in order to create an prototype, movie webpage that uses our knowledge based on CSS and HTML. The project wasn't hard nor easy, but it was at the right amount of diffculty for me to handle. So is my partner since he's well knowledge in the field of technologies and coding. We deiced to make an mysterious horror movie. And the name would be "Menance"
            <h2>Content's</h2>
            In order to first create our movie prototype webpage, me and my partner first have to make a plan first. And in the pickcode website, we created a section specfically for planning called "plan.md"
            Inside the plan.md section, it includes CSS and HTML like:
            <ul>
                <li>Divs</li>
                <li>Spans</li>
                <li>Color's</li>
                <li>Font-families</li>
                <li>Background color</li>
                <li>Script of the movie</li>
                <li>Text color and font size</li>
                <Li>Headings and Titles for the WebPage</Li>
                <Li>Id to create different classes for different CSS</Li>
                <Li>Border-Raidus</Li>
                <li>Links and Images</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            There was several challenges me and my partner come across, while trying to do this project. Including trying to figure out which color for the text would fit the best for the background of our webpage and how to make our text centered, left spaced more and many more.
            But the one that I specfically struggled on was probably having to create span and divs. The reason is that, I didn't know the difference between the two, but I think mainly divs is for longer stuff to be put inside. Whereas span, is for shorter things. However the main problem was that I didn't know how to really add span and div class, even though we learn this in HTML section long time ago..
            Basically, I wanted to make the h2 with different color of the text, size, font and other things. But I didn't know how to do that, because if I just do body or background it would just change the whole thing. So I asked my partner Luka who was well diversed in the fields of technologies and he showed the me proper code.
            He wrapped the h2 first in div element and then added a class to it calling "story". And then when we go into the CSS section I tryed .story {} and it worked with several elements in there like color, fonts and etc.
            <h2>TakeAways</h2>
            The main code I added and to change the h2 of the script of the story was
             
            '''
            .story {
    letter-spacing: 6px;
    color: rgb(178, 181, 181);
    font-size: 20px;
    left: 30px; 
             '''
      
    
                <h2>Further Steps</h2>
            The next time, if we ever get a chance to work on this project again, I hope that me and my partner can add an sequel to our movie webpage next time. Because for this movie, we didn't really add an sequel towards the end. And submit buttons on questions and answers. As I've been absent for a quite long time due to personal issues and I've got lots of things on my hands to work on.
            Honestly, if there was one more day extended for the project, then perhaps we could of finished and added an sequel. (Note: I appericate for my partner's hardwork and him having to basically do 60% of the work, since I've got no idea of what was going on, when I return from my absent)
            <h2>Skills I've Learned from this Project</h2>
            Some skills I've learn from this project specfically is definitely, interacting and assiocating with my partner more often. Because they always say communication is key. By communicating with my partner in class, we were able to diverse each section up for each person. Like we would split the work up and determine who does what and what.
              Another skill I learned (Not sure if this is an actual skill) was probably me searching up things and trying to resort code problems instead of asking the teacher. I know asking the teacher is really useful in this case but from my other classes, this one teacher said "If you don't know something, your first resort is always yourself, and the resources infront of you. The second resort is your partner. And the last resort should be the teacher."
