            <h2>Background Context</h2>
            <p><h4>For this project, we were told to make an adventure type "game" using our IDE. Well techincally, you CAN still use your github, to do this whole project but the whole PURPOSE of this project IS to get more familiar to our IDE so we won't struggle it on as much and we will get to know it much better.
            however before diving deeper. I just want to explain how this adventure project came to be and what we had to do. First, our teacher asked us to fill out an google form, and told us to fill out any idea that we had in our mind or could be potential use for adventures ideas. And so we did.</h4></p> 
            <p><h4>After a few minute and there were tons of ideas. Since our teacher was really since and organized the ideas for us there were up to 50+ ideas. Then our teacher ask us to fill out our top 3 choices for our adventures. Usually you think this would take a few seconds or so to look through and decide
            but thats not the case for me. For me, it took me almost the whole period just to choose top 3 option because all of the topic my classmates pick were all interesting. However if I remebered correctly my top 3 were Isekai'd into a fantasy world, reincarnated into a slime into another world and lastly, skidibdi toilet invasion. 
            And then I finally submitted the form. The next day, when we came to class, on the front projector board, our teacher made a list of who's choices most matched with others. I quickly look through the list and I found my 2 partners. One of which my partner was my friend Leo, and the other one was my classmate (The name will not be included for privacy)
            Which to be first, I felt a little disappointed, not in a way that I didn't want to work with them to, but I wanted to work with my other close friend but later on more in working on this project, I found myself able to work with my partner well. 
            Now that you know a little context of this adventure project using IDE, I'll dive deeper into the "Real" plot of this project.</h4></p>
            <h2>Contents</h2>
            Okay so for the contents originally I was planning to name all of the files path and what they would led into other options, however if I did do that, that will take an eternity. So basically I'm just quickly sum up all the contents avable.
            The contents includes: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Drawing planning sheet </li>
                    <li>Our plans</li>
                    <li>And most if not all the choices in the adventures, and I believe it has up to 10+ different paths for each choices you take.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>>At first, when me and my partners were planning for this adventure project, it looked really overwhelming. However, after thinking and discussing with my partners it's actually quite simple. But first how will we start off this project? Well, since you need different choices that leds to different results, we have to brainstorm a lot of them.So 
            in order to make my life for both easier for me and my partners we divided to split up the work. My partner will put the ideas in the google drawing so whomever is viewing the drawing of our different choices to different path they will have an easier time. And I'll brainstorm the different ideas. So I created a  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eeAmLwzMT9_0eRKtA3LoVeIKc7rP2t24zRuAeJvbqwY/edit?usp=sharing">seperate google doc</a>.</p> Of course with this said,
            <p>I still had to contributed to the google drawing planning, because I can't just let my partners do all the work by themselves. But for the google doc, I can do it by myself since it will be easier to brainstorm. Since our main topic revolves around isekai'd into a fantasy world, many sub-choices intrigues me, for exmaple I first started brainstorm of creating 2 main paths. 
            Oringinally, I had to create 3 paths however it would take way too long and would be very time consuming so I decided not to create 3 paths. But 2. Just to list a few, for the main path that will led you to 2 sub main paths would be that, the main option being "You going to a grocery store and restocking for supplies, however you encounter a gang of people trying to harrass a girl"</p>
            <p>And the choices for that were, "trying to helping the girl", or "running away like a coward". The results were almost the identitcal to each other, since either way you still died. If you choose helping the girl, you died as a result of getting stabbed by a knife. And if you decide to choose to run away like a coward, you eventually get hit by a truck.
            However, the main differences is the good and bad path. Of course, if you choose the helping choice, good thing will bestow upon you after reincarnating. However if you choose running away, bad thing will bestow upon you. Now you get a general gist of what and how planning is done. Since if I keep explaining the planning it will be the same process over and over again. So
            now let's move on into the main challenges and the results of the project.</p>
            <h2>Result/Challenges</h2>
            So, for the result of this project, I must say I'm quite proud of this project that me and my partners create. However when it was the day for my classmates to test out our game, there are some bugs and issues that occur and some feedbacks. To be honest, for this feeddback I don't know if you count it as a compliment or a needs to change thingy. Because one of the major critcism we had were,
            the whole process or reading and clicking was too boring. I mean I kind of could relate to this issues since after all, my partner did wanted to do the extra credit for extra grade so we did it on a HTML format, however the only 2 color were black and white, so it kind of is boring to play around with.
                And I think we could of added a background to our HTML adventure project, because for one group that I visited they also did their project in their HTML format and they did add like an image to their background to make it more interesting for the players and the audiences.
                Another small issue we came across and got feedback on slack, was people asking if there were suppose to be an end to our project. Since when me and my partners were making the project we made it so that there isn't a "true ending" to the project but instead, everytime you died you always loop back to the beginning like an infinite loop. We made it this wway because we don't want you to just die when you click on an choice, since now you have nowwhere to go 
                and you have to go all the way back to the main file starting point again. So we decide to make it easier and making you stuck in a loop but with various choices and results to explore. Last but least, the main challenge that I came across were sometimes the links directing to a certain file would not work and be broken instead. Now this is very troublemsome because I had to manually see which file is connected to which and the deeper the file is the harder it is to search for it
                since the files for my project work in a way like this. There's a hierarchy of files that is located at the beginning and as players start to press more and more choices they dive deeper into the file. But in the end I managed to resolved this issue at ease.
                Now for the challenges, to be honest there weren't many challenges during this project.
