            <h2>Background Context Before Diving in</h2>
            <p>For this project, we were told to make an adventure type "game" using our IDE. Well techincally, you CAN still use your github, to do this whole project but the whole PURPOSE of this project IS to get more familiar to our IDE so we won't struggle it on as much and we will get to know it much better.
            however before diving deeper. I just want to explain how this adventure project came to be and what we had to do. First, our teacher asked us to fill out an google form, and told us to fill out any idea that we had in our mind or could be potential use for adventures ideas. And so we did. 
            After a few minute and there were tons of ideas. Since our teacher was really since and organized the ideas for us there were up to 50+ ideas. Then our teacher ask us to fill out our top 3 choices for our adventures. Usually you think this would take a few seconds or so to look through and decide
            but thats not the case for me. For me, it took me almost the whole period just to choose top 3 option because all of the topic my classmates pick were all interesting. However if I remebered correctly my top 3 were Isekai'd into a fantasy world, reincarnated into a slime into another world and lastly, skidibdi toilet invasion. 
            And then I finally submitted the form. The next day, when we came to class, on the front projector board, our teacher made a list of who's choices most matched with others. I quickly look through the list and I found my 2 partners. One of which my partner was my friend Leo, and the other one was my classmate (The name will not be included for privacy)
            Which to be first, I felt a little disappointed, not in a way that I didn't want to work with them to, but I wanted to work with my other close friend but later on more in working on this project, I found myself able to work with my partner well. 
            Now that you know a little context of this adventure project using IDE, I'll dive deeper into the "Real" plot of this project.
